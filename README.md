# [DestructEngine](https://destruct.co/)

DestructEngine is the source code that powers the website [Destruct.co](https://destruct.co/) - a service that encrypts a user-entered string with javascript, stores the encrypted text in MySQL, and appends the "share url" with the one-off password. After being viewed, the message is forever erased.

I owe the existence of this project to the hard work of dozens of individuals. Check the LICENSE file for a complete list.
